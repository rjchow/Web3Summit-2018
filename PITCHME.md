@quote[Matrix defines a set of open APIs for decentralised communication, suitable for securely publishing, persisting and subscribing to data over a global open federation of servers with no single point of control. Uses include Instant Messaging, Voice over IP signalling, IOT communication, and bridging together existing communication silos - providing the basis of a new open real-time communication ecosystem.]

@snap[west]
Aragon is a project that aims to disintermediate the creation and maintenance of organizational structures by using blockchain technology. We want to empower people across the world to easily and securely manage their organizations. We provide the tools for anyone to become an entrepreneur and run their own organization, to take control of their own lives.
<br><br>
By making it possible for everyone in the world to organize, we are enabling a borderless, permissionless and more efficient creation of value.

- Uses some pretty neat decentralised technologies
- Potential framework we can use to build cross-border project governance, e.g OpenCerts

### Governance

---

Talk about what Governance is and why it is necessary for Ethereum / Web 3
---
Declare your Governance rules such that it is fair regardless of which role you play, i.e you do not know which role you will play in advance
