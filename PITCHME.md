### Matrix

Matrix defines a set of open APIs for decentralised communication, suitable for securely publishing, persisting and subscribing to data over a global open federation of servers with no single point of control. Uses include Instant Messaging (IM), Voice over IP (VoIP) signalling, Internet of Things (IoT) communication, and bridging together existing communication silos - providing the basis of a new open real-time communication ecosystem.

Enable the use of various:
transports: TCP, UDP, SCTP, UDT, uTP, QUIC, SSH, etc.
authenticated transports: TLS, DTLS, CurveCP, SSH
Make efficient use of sockets (connection reuse)
Enable communications between peers to be multiplexed over one socket (avoiding handshake overhead)
Enable multiprotocols and respective versions to be used between peers, using a negotiation process
Be backwards compatible
Work in current systems
Use the full capabilities of current network technologies
Have NAT traversal
Enable connections to be relayed
Enable encrypted channels
Make efficient use of underlying transports (e.g. native stream muxing, native auth, etc.)
